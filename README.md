Welcome to Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our Solar System!

**Key Facts:**
*   **Largest Planet:** So big that all other planets in the solar system could fit inside it (more than 1,300 Earths!).
*   **Great Red Spot:** A gigantic storm, wider than Earth, that has been raging for centuries.
*   **Shortest Day:** Rotates faster than any other planet, completing a day in just about 10 Earth hours.
*   **Strong Magnetic Field:** Possesses the strongest magnetic field of any planet, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.
*   **King of Moons:** Has 95 officially recognized moons (as of early 2024), with many more awaiting confirmation.

**Jupiter's Moons:**
*   Jupiter is famous for its four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons: [Explore the Galilean Moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)](#jupiter-galilean-moons).
*   Beyond these, a vast collection of smaller moons orbits the gas giant, each with its own unique characteristics.

### <a name="jupiter-galilean-moons"></a>üõ∞Ô∏è Jupiter's Galilean Moons

These four moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, are worlds in their own right:

*   **Io:** The most volcanically active world in the Solar System. Its surface is constantly being reshaped by hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting plumes hundreds of kilometers high.
*   **Europa:** Covered by a smooth, icy shell, Europa is believed to hide a vast saltwater ocean beneath its surface. This ocean makes Europa a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life.
*   **Ganymede:** The largest moon in the entire Solar System (even bigger than the planet Mercury!). It's also the only moon known to have its own magnetic field.
*   **Callisto:** A heavily cratered and ancient surface, suggesting it's less geologically active than its siblings. It may also harbor a subsurface ocean, though deeper down than Europa's.

## <a name="saturn"></a>ü™ê Saturn - The Ringed Jewel

Welcome to Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, renowned for its breathtaking system of icy rings!

**Key Facts:**
*   **Spectacular Ring System:** Saturn's most famous feature is its complex system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles, with some rocky debris and dust.
*   **Least Dense Planet:** Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system. If there were a bathtub large enough, Saturn would float in water!
*   **Lord of the Rings (and Moons):** As of early 2024, Saturn has 146 officially recognized moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System, surpassing Jupiter.

**Saturn's Moons:**
*   Saturn hosts a diverse family of moons. Two of the most fascinating are:
    *   [Visit Titan - A Moon with an Atmosphere](#saturn-titan)
    *   [Explore Enceladus - An Icy Geyser World](#saturn-enceladus)
*   Many other smaller moons orbit Saturn, contributing to the dynamic nature of its system.

### <a name="saturn-titan"></a>üõ∞Ô∏è Titan - Saturn's Largest Moon

Titan is a truly unique world, standing out among all moons in the Solar System.

**Key Facts:**
*   **Dense Atmosphere:** The only moon known to have a thick, planet-like atmosphere, which is mostly nitrogen with some methane and ethane.
*   **Liquid on Surface:** Features stable bodies of surface liquid, including lakes, rivers, and seas of liquid methane and ethane.
*   **Prebiotic Chemistry:** Its atmosphere and surface conditions are of great interest for studying potential prebiotic chemical processes.

### <a name="saturn-enceladus"></a>üõ∞Ô∏è Enceladus - The Active Moon

Enceladus is a small, icy moon that has surprised scientists with its geological activity.

**Key Facts:**
*   **Icy Shell & Subsurface Ocean:** Covered by a layer of ice, beneath which lies a global saltwater ocean.
*   **Geysers:** Most famously, Enceladus erupts towering plumes (geysers) of water ice and vapor from "tiger stripes" fractures near its south pole. These geysers feed Saturn's E ring.
*   **Potential for Habitability:** The presence of a subsurface ocean, hydrothermal vents, and organic molecules makes Enceladus a key target in the search for habitable environments.

## <a name="uranus"></a>ü™ê Uranus - The Ice Giant

Welcome to Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, often referred to as an "ice giant."

**Key Facts:**
*   **Ice Giant:** Composed of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, with a dense, icy mantle surrounding a rocky core.
*   **Sideways Rotation:** Uniquely, Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees, making it appear to roll around the Sun.
*   **Faint Rings & Numerous Moons:** Possesses a system of faint rings and 27 known moons.
*   **Blue-Green Hue:** Its distinct blue-green color is due to methane in its upper atmosphere, which absorbs red light.

**Uranus's Moons:**
*   Uranus has 27 known moons, primarily named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
*   **Titania** is the largest, and **Miranda** is notable for its incredibly varied and bizarre, patchwork surface, suggesting a complex geological past.

## <a name="neptune"></a>üåä Neptune - The Blue World

Prepare to explore Neptune, the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system.

**Key Facts:**
*   **Farthest Planet:** The most distant planet from the Sun (following the reclassification of Pluto).
*   **Ice Giant Twin:** Similar in composition to Uranus, making it the other "ice giant" with an icy mantle and a rocky core.
*   **Supersonic Winds:** Home to the strongest winds in the Solar System, which can exceed 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph), whipping up massive storms like the Great Dark Spot (though this feature is transient).
*   **Deep Blue Color:** Its vibrant, deep blue color is also due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light even more effectively than Uranus due to its greater distance from the Sun.
*   **Faint Rings & Moons:** Neptune has a faint system of rings and 14 known moons.

**Neptune's Moons:**
*   Neptune's largest moon, **Triton**, is unique. It has a retrograde orbit (orbiting in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation), suggesting it may be a captured Kuiper Belt Object.
*   Triton is extremely cold and features geysers erupting nitrogen ice and dust.
